# A Journey By Cloud — Roadmap & Progress Tracker

This repo tracks my progress through https://learntocloud.guide using GitHub Issues + a GitHub Project board.

## How I Track Progress
- Each Topic = GitHub Issue
- Each Issue includes:
  - What I studied
  - Hands-on tasks completed
  - Evidence (links, screenshots, repo links)
  - Notes + reflections
- I move Issues across the Project board: Backlog → In Progress → Done
